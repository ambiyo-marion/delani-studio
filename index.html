    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>When you work with us, you are a part of a team
        of committed collaborators. All aspects of our software development process
        are integrated, interactive <br>
        and agile.<br>
        Our approach unifies design, development
        and product management to create exceptional products. <br>
        <br>
        We start each project by understanding
        your business goals, the user's needs and the product requirements.<br>
        <br>
        Then we help translate them
        into effective and elegant solutions.</p>

        <p>Before we sign a contract or  write a line of code our team will spend the necessary
          time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
          <br>
          The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high-level statement of work. <br>
          <br>
          Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need</p>
